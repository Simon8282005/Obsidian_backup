	"The Wandering Earth" (流浪地球) is a Chinese science fiction film released in 2019. It is directed by Frant Gwo and based on a novella by Liu Cixin. Here is a detailed synopsis of the movie:

	In the near future, the sun has begun to expand, and humanity faces extinction. In response, the United Earth Government initiates the "Wandering Earth" project, a *massive 大量*  effort to move the Earth out of the solar system to a new home in another star system.

	To achieve this feat, the government constructs thousands of giant engines on the surface of the Earth, which will *propel 推进* the planet towards its new destination. However, as the Earth begins its journey, it encounters a series of unexpected obstacles, including a collision with Jupiter's moon, Callisto.

	The story follows a group of astronauts and other characters as they try to steer the Earth on its journey and overcome the various challenges that arise along the way. The main *protagonist  主角* is Liu Peiqiang, a former astronaut who is recruited to help save the Earth when the Wandering Earth project goes awry.

	As the Earth approaches its new home, a planet called Proxima Centauri, the crew must navigate a final set of obstacles, including a massive asteroid field and a malfunctioning engine. In a dramatic finale, Liu sacrifices himself to save the Earth and ensure the survival of humanity.

	Overall, "The Wandering Earth" is a thrilling science fiction adventure that explores themes of sacrifice, teamwork, and the *resilience 弹性* of the human spirit in the face of overwhelming challenges.
